# PeopleRank Algorithm using Decision Engine in DTNs

PeopleRank is one of the many message forwarding algorithms on delay tolerance networks. As we know in DTNs, network behavior is modeled after real-world human social behavior, so it's as if each node in a topology is an independent human being. Likewise in this algorithm, the PeopleRank principle itself is where each node has a “ranking” which becomes the measuring point of each node called “PeopleRank”. This ranking is influenced by 2 factors, namely Peer Rank and Friend Size. A friend's peer rank is directly proportional to the PeopleRank value, whereas the Friend Size is inversely proportional to the People Rank value, which means that the more friends this node has, the smaller its PeopleRank.
